Task 04: Implement a Sodoku Solver

Languages Used: C++

Concepts Used: define, Functions, Loops, 2-D Array, Backtracking etc.

Details: In this task, I tried to implement a Sudoku Solver. For that, I created one function to check whether a digit is already present in the respective row or column or 3*3 grid, and then I took one more function to solve sudoku in that function first I checked if is there any places that are not yet filled and then I filled digits if it is not present.

What did I learn from this?

How to implement 2-D Array.

How to solve a sudoku puzzle (the logic behind it).

How to define any variable globally.

How and where to use Backtracking.
